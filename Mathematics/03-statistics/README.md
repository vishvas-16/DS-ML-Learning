### 00 â€” Fitting a Normal Distribution (Statistical Modeling)  
**Goal:**  
Show how to analyze a dataset of human heights, visualize it using histograms and scatter plots, and fit a normal distribution to check how well the data follows a bell curve.  

**Key Steps Covered:**  
1. Load and explore the `height_cm` dataset (list of raw values).  
2. Compute **frequencies and densities** from raw data using histogram binning.  
3. Plot scatter plots for raw heights, frequencies, and densities.  
4. Fit and visualize a **normal distribution curve** over the histogram.  

**Takeaways:**  
- Raw data doesnâ€™t store frequency â€” itâ€™s computed by binning (like `np.histogram`).  
- Scatter plots can show either **raw data points**, **frequency per bin**, or **density per bin**.  
- A normal distribution is a good model for many natural datasets like human height.
