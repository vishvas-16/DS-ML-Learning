    "# Understanding Matrix Multiplication with Einstein Summation\n",

    "This notebook explains how the Einstein summation convention (often called `einsum`) simplifies the multiplication of non-square matrices and makes the dimensions of the resulting matrix intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Core Problem:** When multiplying two matrices, say **A** and **B**, the number of columns in the first matrix (**A**) must equal the number of rows in the second matrix (**B**). The resulting matrix, **C**, will then have the same number of rows as **A** and the same number of columns as **B**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's formalize this:\n",
    "- If matrix **A** has dimensions `(m, n)` (m rows, n columns).\n",
    "- And matrix **B** has dimensions `(n, p)` (n rows, p columns).\n",
    "- The resulting matrix **C** will have dimensions `(m, p)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keeping track of these indices can sometimes be confusing. Einstein summation provides a clear and concise way to represent this operation."

    "## 2. Introducing Einstein Summation Convention\n",
    "\n",
    "The Einstein summation convention is a notation that simplifies these kinds of operations. The core rules are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Repeated indices are summed over.** If an index appears on both the input side, it's the index we sum across (like `k` in the formula above).\n",
    "2.  **Indices that are not repeated define the output.** The indices that appear only once on the input side will be the indices of the resulting matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notation is expressed as a string: `\"input_indices -> output_indices\"`.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our matrix multiplication, we can describe the matrices as:\n",
    "- Matrix A has dimensions represented by indices `i` and `j` -> `ij`.\n",
    "- Matrix B has dimensions represented by indices `j` and `k` -> `jk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The multiplication is therefore written as `ij,jk`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The index `j` is **repeated**, so it's the one we sum over. This corresponds to the inner dimension that must match.\n",
    "- The indices `i` and `k` are **not repeated**. These will form the dimensions of our output matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the complete `einsum` string is: **`ij,jk->ik`**\n",
    "\n",
    "This simple string tells us everything:\n",
    "- We are multiplying a matrix `(i, j)` with a matrix `(j, k)`.\n",
    "- The `j` dimension is summed over.\n",
    "- The resulting matrix will have dimensions `(i, k)`."

    "The Einstein summation convention offers a powerful and intuitive way to think about matrix and tensor operations.\n",

    "For the multiplication of two matrices `A` and `B`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Identify the indices:** Let `A` be `ij` and `B` be `jk`.\n",
    "2.  **Find the common index:** The index `j` appears in both. This represents the inner dimension that must match and will be summed over during the multiplication.\n",
    "3.  **Determine the output indices:** The remaining indices, `i` and `k`, define the shape of the resulting matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `ij,jk->ik` is a complete and unambiguous description of the operation. It elegantly confirms that the output matrix's shape is `(rows of first matrix, columns of second matrix)`."
