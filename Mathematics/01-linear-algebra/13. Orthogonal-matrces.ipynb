    "\n",
    "An **orthogonal matrix** is a square matrix whose columns (and rows) form an *orthonormal set* of vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "This means the matrix can be seen as a transformation matrix where the column vectors define a new basis. In this new basis, all basis vectors are perpendicular to each other and have a length of 1."

    "\n",
    "The most important property of an orthogonal matrix $A$ arises when you multiply it by its transpose, $A^T$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let the matrix $A$ be composed of column vectors $a_1, a_2, \\dots, a_n$:\n",
