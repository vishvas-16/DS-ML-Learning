### 00 â€” Use of Linear Algebra in ML
**Goal:**  
Turn conceptual math notes into runnable demos showing:  
- **Training data (dots)** vs **hypothesis function (dashed line)** vs **final regression line (solid)**.  
- The **vector form** `h(x) = Î¸áµ€ x` where `Î¸ = [b, w]` (bias and weight).  
- **Decision boundary** example for classification (`Î¸áµ€x = 0`).  

**Key Steps Covered:**
1. **Data points:** Represent features and labels, with natural noise.  
2. **Hypothesis function:** Initial guess with arbitrary parameters.  
3. **Regression line:** Computed using the **normal equation** (closed-form least squares).  
4. **Vector form:** Compact representation for predictions.  
5. **Decision boundary:** For classification, separates classes with a linear function.

**Takeaways:**
- The normal equation finds the optimal parameters without iterative methods.  
- Including bias in the feature vector (`x = [1, feature]`) simplifies computation.  
- Decision boundaries are where the linear model output equals zero.
